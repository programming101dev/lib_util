# lib_util Repository Guide

Welcome to the `lib_util` repository — utility functions, part of the Programming 101 C library collection. This guide will help you set up, build, and install the library.

## **Cloning the Repository**

Clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/programming101dev/lib_util.git
```

Navigate to the cloned directory:

```bash
cd lib_util
```

Ensure the scripts are executable:

```bash
chmod +x *.sh
```

## **Prerequisites**

To ensure you have all of the required tools installed, run:

```bash
./check-env.sh
```

If you are missing tools follow these [instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZPqlPD1mie5iwJ2XAcNGz7WeA86dTLerFXs9sAuwCco/edit?usp=drive_link). If something still looks wrong, `./doctor.sh` reports what actually works on this machine for this project.

## **Configuring the Build**

Tell CMake which compiler you want to use:

```bash
./change-compiler.sh -c <compiler>
```

To see the list of possible compilers:

```bash
cat supported_c_compilers.txt
```

Run it again any time to switch compilers; each compiler configures into its own build directory (e.g. `build-clang`, `build-gcc-15`).

## **Building**

To build the library run:

```bash
./build.sh
```

This compiles through the strict analysis pipeline: the clang-format check, clang-tidy, cppcheck, the Clang static analyzer, and hundreds of warnings under `-Werror`. `./build.sh -f` applies the formatter and tidy fixes in place.

## **Testing**

`./check.sh` is the one command to run before you submit: the format check, the strict build, the tests, and a short fuzz smoke run, with a single PASS/FAIL at the end.
This library does not have a `test/` tree yet, so `./test.sh` reports that and exits; the rest of the gate still runs.

## **Installing**

To install the library run:

```bash
./install.sh
```

You may need to run it via sudo, or give the user account access to the install directories. `./uninstall.sh` removes it again.

## **Adding or Removing Files**

The `CMakeLists.txt` is fixed and shared across every repository — do not edit it. When you add or remove a source or header, edit the lists in `config.cmake` (`p101_util_SOURCES`, `p101_util_HEADERS`, and `p101_util_LINK_LIBRARIES`), then re-configure and build:

```bash
./change-compiler.sh -c <compiler>
./build.sh
```
